The `model.transform(df)` applies the trained model to the DataFrame, and the subsequent `select` statement extracts the \"prediction\" and \"label\" columns. The resulting DataFrame is then converted to an RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset), where each row is transformed into a tuple of floating-point values. These tuples represent the predicted and actual values. The `RegressionMetrics` class is then applied to this RDD, and various regression metrics are computed. The metrics include the mean squared error (`metrics.meanSquaredError`), root mean squared error (`metrics.rootMeanSquaredError`), R-squared (`metrics.r2`), mean absolute error (`metrics.meanAbsoluteError`), and explained variance (`metrics.explainedVariance`). These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance in terms of prediction accuracy, goodness of fit, and variability explained.\n",
